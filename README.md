# NeovimConfig

This repository contains the configurations I utilize in order to achieve a satisfactory workflow when using
**Neovim**. It has various plugs that, for instance, make file exploration easier and integrate conveniences like
recommendations and auto-fill for brackets. The configuration is made using the programming language **Lua**.

**NodeJS** is required for the coc plug. This plug is responsible for the suggestions while programming. **Git** is
used to clone **Packer**, which is used for managing the plugs.

Install npm, nodejs and git with the package manager of your Linux distribution,
> Debian-based Linux distros: `sudo apt install npm nodejs git`

> Arch-based Linux distros: `sudo pacman -S npm nodejs git`

Clone Packer using Git.
> git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim

ðŸš€ Running the program
---
Now that you have all the dependencies installed, move the configuration files to `.config/nvim/` directory. After
this, enter the `init.lua` file with Neovim: `nvim init.lua`. Enter the command-line mode and type `:PackerInstall`
to have all the dependencies installed. After all the work, you should finally be able to use the configurations!

If you end up altering any of the plugs, make sure you enter command-line mode and type `:PackerSync` in order to 
apply the changes.
